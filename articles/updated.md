hello Capture Team ! This is a start of a new chapter.
I started my career with MSCI ESG Research Team as a Research.
Love Working there, I was from technical background but eventually 
landed in a much say an ESG researcher understanding their expsoure model
lot's of reading but can say 30% was coding stuff so enjoy a lot.
Hope my knowledge from ESG Research will help the Capture team ðŸ¤ž.
